# Docker Taskfile Public Tasks

## What is this Taskfile?

A cross-platform Taskfile for installing Docker, managing upgrades, and running
common container and image operations.

macOS uses Homebrew Cask to install Docker Desktop. Linux uses the official
convenience script from `get.docker.com` (supports apt and dnf), then
automatically adds the current user to the `docker` group so Docker runs
without `sudo` after a re-login. Windows uses winget to install Docker Desktop.

## Usage

### Standalone

```sh
task -t taskfiles/docker/Taskfile.yml install
task -t taskfiles/docker/Taskfile.yml version
task -t taskfiles/docker/Taskfile.yml ps
```

### Included

```yaml
includes:
  docker: ./taskfiles/docker/Taskfile.yml
```

Then run:

```sh
task docker:install
task docker:version
task docker:ps
```

| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DOCKER_IMAGE`      | _(empty)_    | Image name and tag used by `build` and `pull`            |

| `DOCKER_VERSION`    | _(empty)_    | Pin a Docker release for `install` on Linux and Windows; has no effect on macOS (Homebrew Cask cannot pin Docker Desktop) |

## Notes

**Linux:** `install` automatically runs `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` after
the engine is set up. Log out and back in for the change to take effect. The
step is skipped if the user is already in the `docker` group or is running as
root.

**macOS:** Docker Desktop must be opened at least once after installation to
complete the initial VM and daemon setup. `brew install --cask docker` does not
start Docker automatically.

**`prune:all`** is destructive and irreversible. It removes all stopped
containers, all unused images, unused networks, and all volumes not attached to
a running container. Confirmation is required before it runs.
